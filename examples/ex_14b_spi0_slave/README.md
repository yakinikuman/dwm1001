# DWM1001 - ex_14b_spi0_slave

## Overview

This example project give a simple template for using the DWM1001 as a 'SPI Slave' device.
This allows the DWM1001 board to appear to a 'SPI Master' system as a SPI device. The accompanying spi_master.py script may be run on an appropriately configured (SPI enabled and Python 3 with py-spidev installed) Raspberry Pi to interact as master with the DWM1001 slave code.  This project was developed using a DWM1001-DEV board and a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

The focus of this project is to provide an example of SPI-Slave IO connectivity, and not so much the SPI-device "functionality".

Currently, this example does not implement a interrupt line to the SPI Master host, although the Device Tree does define a potential line for interrupts.

The choice using of "SPI_0" is due to "SPI-1" being used for DWM1000 communications. Also note that SPI_0 and I2C_0 can not operated at the same time, as the share a common serial controller on the nRF52 SoC. 


## Hardware Setup

The SPI0 pins on the Pi should be connected to the corresponding pins on the DWM1001-DEV board's "Module Development Board RPi connector".  The pin mapping is somewhat user-configurable; see notes in nrf52_dwm1001.overlay.

Pi GPIO 10 (MOSI) <-----> DWM1001 [N].P06

Pi GPIO  9 (MISO) <-----> DWM1001 [N].P07

Pi GPIO 11 (SCLK) <-----> DWM1001 [N].P04

Pi GPIO  8 (CS)   <-----> DWM1001 [N].P03

Pi GND (any ground pin) <-----> DWM1001 GND (any ground pin)


## Building and Running
The build and running is similar to the other examples.
The only complexity is coordinating the operation of two SPI-based systems. But as a DWM1001 developer this is standard procedures.  ;-)
The spi_master.py script is meant to be run on the Raspberry Pi acting as SPI master. The DWM1001 SPI slave will receive a 2-byte user input from the Raspberry Pi over SPI, add 1 to the received value and return it back to the Pi.
